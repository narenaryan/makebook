Problem?
========

I am very fond of listening to audio books,because they soothe me.But famous audio books are costly to download from audible.com .
There are free books from https://librivox.org/ . But main problem is volunteers voice is not so good.One  academical oranization product 
called Lit2Go maintains audio books with premium voice quality for free listening.Speakers voice and accent is excellent.So I always download audio books from that site.

The main problem with Lit2Go is it will not allow us to download entire book as single folder or zip like librivox.There will be atmost 15-23 chapters in each good book.Going to that chapter URL and saving them manually tired me a lot.So I came up with this solution.I created this program that takes url of a book from Lit2Go and downloads all chapters audio files into a single folder that named as book's name.It reduces the burden of downloading them individually.
